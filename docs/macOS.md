# MacOS
MacOS support is courtesy of [Docker-OSX](https://github.com/sickcodes/Docker-OSX).

**Important Note: Ventura is non-functional. If you try to update to it, it will make MacOS, and its apps, not work.**

To setup MacOS, simply run `just mac-install`.

**Important Note: If you select APFS as the filesystem it will also become non functional.**
